## Overview

This mini project is my first experience of creating a real project as a front-end developer! I'm so excited to share it with you.

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible, and even make it better!

As well as making it responsive for small phones, I tried to make it good looking for large screens as well. Another challenge was keeping the HTML semantic, and the CSS clean. Due to my limited experience, I did not apply a mobile-first workflow, but for future projects I will take it into consideration!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Using CSS custom properties to create custom colors:

```css
:root {
  --pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
  --bright-blue: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
  --very-pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
  --desaturated-blue: hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
  --dark-blue: hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
}
```

CSS basic rest:

```css
* {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

img {
  display: block;
}
```

### Continued development

Since I learned a lot on this project, I'm looking forward to trying more challenges from Frontend Mentor.
